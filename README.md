# World Conquest in Godot

We developed a working game simulating World Conquest in Godot as a group. We followed strict agile methodology, and had a rigid chain of command that stopped any bad code from getting merged to main.

## Responsibilities
- [@j0lol](https://github.com/j0lol) - Project lead & only one with `main` write access
- [@meihapps](https://github.com/meihapps) - Reviewer & QA, approved every PR before merge & enforced code quality
- [@RicardoEscuderoA](https://github.com/RicardoEscuderoA) - Backend dev, wrote a lot of game logic near the end when requirements changed
- [@raccnin](https://github.com/raccnin) - Backend dev, wrote most of the early game logic
- [@0cr0wbar0](https://github.com/0cr0wbar0) - Lead documentarian & dev support, documented every meeting and helped us actually get the marks for our work
- [@Attack-Dorito](https://github.com/Attack-Dorito) - Dev support, did 3d modelling & physics simulation

This is a mirror repository. We did development on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/goblin_code/world_conquest), which is now archived for marking purposes. Future development may happen on this repository if needed.
