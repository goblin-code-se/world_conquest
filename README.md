# World Conquest in Godot

We developed a working game simulating World Conquest in Godot as a group. We followed strict agile methodology, and had a rigid chain of command that stopped any bad code from getting merged to main.

## Responsibilities
- @j0lol - Project lead
- mei happs - Reviewer & QA
- @RicardoEscuderoA - Backend dev
- @raccnin - Backend dev
- @0cr0wbar0 - Lead documentarian & dev support
- @Attack-Dorito - Dev support

This is a mirror repository. We did development on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/goblin_code/world_conquest), which is now archived for marking purposes. Future development may happen on this repository if needed.
